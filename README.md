# ECG-EMOTION-ARRHYTHMIA-DETECTION
This ECG arrhythmia-based model detects emotions by mapping arrhythmia types to emotional states like calm or anxiety. Using a CNN architecture with data standardization, early stopping, and optimized convolutional layers, the model achieves 99.98% accuracy in classifying five emotion categories based on heart activity patterns.
